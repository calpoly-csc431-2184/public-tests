# public-tests
Add your public tests to a subdirectory of this repo

NOTE: some of these tests rely on features that are not 
fully specified in the assignments. So, for instance,
in frosty/nested_fns.co, there are equality checks
on booleans, and some interesting shadowing of 'z'.
I've put what I believe to be a no-advanced-features
version of this called frosty-nested_fns.co in the
jbc directory.
